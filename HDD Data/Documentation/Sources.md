In the documentation folder I provide you with the article about Proactive Prediction of Hard Disk Drive Failure given in pdf format about and also below you can find some very useful links for the HDD failures in the predictive maintenance.

Link do BackBlaze website where you can find not only benchmark datasets but also a lot of different and useful reports about the published statistics and insights based on the hard drives: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/hard-drive-test-data.html

Other link to useful articles:
1) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920319700 - this is the article titled: "A disk failure prediction method based on LSTM network due to its individual specificity";
2) https://www.backblaze.com/blog/using-machine-learning-to-predict-hard-drive-failures/ - article from BackBlaze website titled: "Using Machine Learning to Predict Hard Drive Failures";
3) article from the international journal of distributed sensor networks titled: "Random-forest-based failure prediction for hard disk drives";
4) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314682447_Hard_Drive_Failure_Prediction_using_Decision_Trees this is the article from the research gate about "Hard Drive Failure Prediction using Decision Trees";
