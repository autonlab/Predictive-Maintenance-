Below I've included links to articles and github that can serve as quite a resource when doing research on this database yourself:

Article: L. P. Silvestrin, M. Hoogendoorn and G. Koole, "A Comparative Study of State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Algorithms for Predictive Maintenance," 2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI), 2019, pp. 760-767, doi: 10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9003044. 
The article can be found at the following link: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ger-Koole-2/publication/339404826_A_Comparative_Study_of_State-of-the-Art_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Predictive_Maintenance/links/5ef1bbf6a6fdcc73be96d7ba/A-Comparative-Study-of-State-of-the-Art-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Predictive-Maintenance.pdf
