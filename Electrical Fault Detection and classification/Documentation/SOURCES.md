Here you can find some useful links to original sources with the dataset and codes used for this project analysis purpose.

Originally the dataset was downloaded from the kaggle website and there is also located some codes that you may find useful while using this dataset. You can access this website under the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/esathyaprakash/electrical-fault-detection-and-classification

distribution networks. Measurement, 184:109947, 2021.

Here is also another interesting article which was written in order to bring awareness awareness to the developing of fault detection systems using the data collected from sensor devices/physical devices of various systems for predictive maintenance.
