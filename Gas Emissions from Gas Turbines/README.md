DATASET DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of this dataset is to predict the possible gas emissions (NO, Cox) from a gas turbine
The following dataset comes from a gas turbine. We can distinguish here 11 variables (nine inputs and two targets).
Each of the columns present different sensor readings.
In total, for each of the datasets, we have in total 36.733 values collected in a period of over 5 years.
In the input variables we have 2 groups: ambient variables and process parameters.
Columns description is as follows:
AT -Ambient Temperature given in C degrees
AP – Ambient pressure given in mbar
AH – Ambient Humidity given in %
AFDP – Air filter difference pressure given in mbar 
GTEP – Gas turbine exhaust pressure given in mbar 
TIT – Turbine inlet temperature given in  C degrees
TAT – Turbine after temperature given in C degrees
CDP – Compressor discharge pressure mbar 
TEY – Turbine energy yield given in MWH
CO – Carbon monoxide given in mg/m3 
NOx – Nitrogen oxides given in mg/m3
