The dataset is originally taken from the Kaggle website, where you can download the benchmark dataset. This option is available under the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brjapon/gearbox-fault-diagnosis

The dataset consists of vibration sensors recorded by using SpectraQuest's Gearbox Fault Diagnostics Simulator.
In order to collect enough records, 4 vibration sensors, placed in four different direction were used. There was also added the variation of load which varied from 0 to 90 percent.

The dataset also consist of 2 sub data files:
	1) Healthy - 10 files
	2) Broken Tooth - 10 files

Together we have 20 files from both the Healthy and the broken gearbox.
In total the number of attributes for this dataset is 2021119.

Each of the data is described in the following way:

Example for Healthy data file: h30hz90 --> h stands for healthy; 30 Hz means the recording frequency and 90 stands for loading condition (in this case it is 90 percent)
Exmple for Broken Tooth data file: b30hz0 b stands for broken; 30 Hz means the recording frequency; 0 stands for loading condition (in this case it is 0 percent)
