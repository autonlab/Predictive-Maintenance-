# SOLAR POWER GENERATION - DATASET DESCRIPTION:

The Datasets folder consist of 4 data files - the data in this files has been collected from 2 solar power plants in a period of 34 days.
2 files belongs to one solar power plant and 2 other files belong to the second one.
The files are named as follows:
- Plant_1_Generation_Data
- Plant_1_Weather_Sensor_Data
- Plant_2_Generation_Data
- Plant_2_Weather_Sensor_Data

The Generation_Data files relate to the power generation datasets and are gathered at the inverter level - which means that each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The Weather_Sensor_Data files are gathered at a plant level and relate to sensor readings placed on the plants.


Analysis of this dataset might give the answers to the following questions:
* Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
* Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
* Can we identify faulty or sub-optimally performing equipment?
