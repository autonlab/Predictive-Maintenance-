I provide also the access via the following link: https://github.com/Iuryck/Machine_Degradation to the sample GitHub code found on the internet (author: Iuryck Santos) about the "component degradation over time, analyzed with machine learning".

The notebook with a code is available also on kaggle website (link provided: https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhavdeepsingh33/one-year-industrial-component-degradation).
